The entire website is built with PicoCSS's philosophy:

> let's keep it graceful and simple.

- Router inspired by: https://phprouter.com/
- Page setup with base template and minimal config.
- PicoCSS extended with Bootstrap Grid for semantic HTML and responsive layouts.
- Form and entity validation inspired by Zod.

Next on the list:

- ORM.
- translation handling.
- some benchmarks to top it off.
- extract the framework into a standalone project.
